# **Overall my activities**

## **Research  Project**
### **Automatic Crosswalk Detection using YOLO and SAHI Techniques**
* Conducted a research project on automatic crosswalk detection using deep learning and object detection techniques.
* Implemented and compared multiple versions of the YOLO model (YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10) for enhanced detection accuracy.
* Integrated the SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) technique to improve detection on high-resolution images and boost model efficiency.
* Achieved a detection accuracy of 75%, with the best performance using YOLOv9 + SAHI.
* Developed and trained models entirely in Python, using a self-curated dataset of street-level imagery.
* Successfully published and presented the research at the IEEE International Electrical Engineering Congress 2025.
